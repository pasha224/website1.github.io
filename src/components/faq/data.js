      answer:
        " The welcome screen includes a 'get started' button, which starts a conversation with your Messenger bot when it is tapped. When a person taps the 'get started' button, the message 'get started' will be posted into the conversation, and your bot is then granted permission to send messages.",

      answer:
        " Messaging apps give users a range of option to communicate. From text, to video, to GIFS, to voice notes, users can use whatever form of messaging is convenient for them and the recipient. If they prefer, they can have entire conversation without a single use of text, making it more flexible and immersive for the user.",
